Now to example 3 -- 

The admin was trying to make a change to help someone in your org, but instead deleted some permissions that now leave your Hybrid deployment unusable. How can you remediate this?

Set up this example by running `run_example3.sh`, then try to launch a job on your local DP and on your remote DP.
