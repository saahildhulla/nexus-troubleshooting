Now to example 3 -- 

Your admin was trying to help someone debug an issue in RabbitMQ, but they deleted something they shouldn't have and now your Remote DP is in a bad state!
OR
Your Remote Data Plane can no longer connect to RabbitMQ. Investigate why and find the fix!

Set up this example by running `run_example3.sh &> /dev/null`, then try to launch a job on your local DP and on your remote DP.
